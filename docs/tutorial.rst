Tutorial

Welcome to the Dask cassandra loader tutorial. This tutorial demonstrates the basics of using
Dask cassandra loader using either a local or a remote Cassandra database.

To install Dask cassandra loader, use

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install dask_cassandra_loader

If you're using dask cassandra loader in a program, you will probably want to use a
virtualenv and install Cerulean into that, together with your other
dependencies.

Setup
=====

The tutorial requires the creation of a keyspace in an existent Cassandra cluster. For this
tutorial it is used the keyspace called `tutorial`. In this example it is assume the local
client cqlsh is installed and configured accordingly.

.. code-block:: bash

    cqlsh -e "create keyspace tutorial with replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1};"

Once the keyspace is created the user needs to create a table and load it. To do that the
user needs to run the `.cql` file under the `dask-cassandra-loader/docs` directory as follow:

.. code-block:: bash

    cqlsh --keyspace=tutorial -f tutorial.cql

Once the table is loaded, the user will have a table called `tab1` with the following schema: 
`create table tab1(id int, year int, month int, day int, timest timestamp, lat float, lon float, PRIMARY KEY((id, year, month)));`
The loaded data has two partitions due two distinct months.


Dask cassandra loader
=====================

The first step to load a table from Cassandra into a Dask data-frame is to create `Loader`.
To do that the user should do the following:

.. code-block:: python

  from dask_cassandra_loader import Loader
  
  dask_cassandra_loader = Loader()


Connect to Cassandra
--------------------

With the loader the user is then able to set a connection to an existent Cassandra cluster.
In this example we assume the user is connecting to local cluster using the default credentials.

.. code-block:: python

  keyspace = 'tutorial'
  clusters = ['127.0.0.1']

  dask_cassandra_loader.connect_to_cassandra(clusters, keyspace, username='cassandra', password='cassandra')


Connect to Dask
---------------

Before a table is loaded it is necessary to connect to a Dask Cluster. For testing proposes
it might be handy to have the option to create a `LocalCluster`. Both options are supported as
the following examples will show.

To create and connect to a local Dask cluster you use the following code:

.. code-block:: python

  dask_cassandra_loader.connect_to_local_dask()

To connect to a remote cluster you use the following code:

.. code-block:: python

  cluster = "host1.domain.nl:9091"
  dask_cassandra_loader.connect_to_dask(cluster):


Read Table
----------

In this example the user will load table `tab1`, project columns `id`, `year`, `month`, `day`,
have a predicate on column `day` (`day = 18`) and only select the partitions for which `id in [18]`,
`year in [2018]` and `month in [11]`. In this example, it is requested to not load all partitions in
case the query qualifies all of them for loading. For more details about the function, the user should
read :doc:`API documentation for dask_cassandra_loader.loader.load_cassandra_table <https://dask-cassandra-loader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apidocs/dask_cassandra_loader.loader.html#dask_cassandra_loader.loader.Loader.load_cassandra_table>`_.

.. code-block:: python

  dask_cassandra_loader.load_cassandra_table('tab1',
                                             ['id', 'year', 'month', 'day'],
                                             [('day', 'equal', [8])],
                                             [('id', [18]), ('year', [2018]),
                                              ('month', [11])],
                                             force=False)

  table = dask_cassandra_loader.keyspace_tables['tab1']

  if table is None:
      raise AssertionError("Table is not supposed to be None!!!")

  if table.data is None:
      raise AssertionError("Table.data is not supposed to be None!!!")

  # Inspect table information
  print(table.data.head())
